# ESP32-Learning-Path
This repository tracks my progress with ESP32 and IoT development. 
**Goal:** To acquire and validate advanced technical skills in Embedded Systems and IoT through hands-on project implementation, focusing on hardware-software integration and industrial communication standards.

---

## 🚀 Overview
The first step in this learning path involves understanding basic IoT concepts. I have prepared a document outlining these fundamentals along with an introduction to the ESP32; you can find it under **"Basic Concepts"**.

The actual first step with the ESP32 is to download and install the Arduino IDE and configure the environment for our board. The steps to follow can be found in **"Config Arduino IDE for ESP32"**.

## 🛠️ Key Projects
This learning path is structured around 5 core projects that encompass hardware control, industrial protocols, and network architecture:

### 1. Environmental Monitor with Real-time Dashboard
* **Objective:** Measure temperature and humidity for real-time visualization on mobile devices.
* **Key Skills:** HTTP/MQTT protocols, sensor library management (DHT11/22), and Wi-Fi stability.

### 2. Automated Pet Feeder
* **Objective:** Control a servomotor via a web interface or physical button to release food.
* **Key Skills:** Web Server implementation (Asynchronous), actuator control, and external power supply management.

### 3. Smart MQTT Lamp
* **Objective:** Control an RGB LED strip (colors and brightness) using the MQTT protocol.
* **Key Skills:** Publish/Subscribe model, Topic architecture, and **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** signal control.

### 4. Security System with ESP32-CAM & Telegram
* **Objective:** Capture photos on motion detection and send them via Telegram.
* **Key Skills:** Camera peripheral handling, **PSRAM memory management**, and Third-party API integration (Telegram Bot API).

### 5. Mesh Network & Gateway (ESP-NOW)
* **Objective:** Create a decentralized network of ESP32 nodes communicating without a central router.
* **Key Skills:** **ESP-NOW** protocol, P2P topologies, and ultra-low power optimization.

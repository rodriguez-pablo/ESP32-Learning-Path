# ESP32-Learning-Path
This repository tracks my progress with ESP32 and IoT development. Goal: International Engineering Certification.

The first step in this learning path involves understanding basic IoT concepts, I have prepared a document
outlining these fundamentals along with an introduction to the ESP32. You can find it under "Basic Concepts".

# ESP32-Learning-Path
This repository tracks my progress with ESP32 and IoT development. 
**Goal:** International Engineering Certification.

The first step in this learning path involves understanding basic IoT concepts. I have prepared a document outlining these fundamentals along with an introduction to the ESP32; you can find it under **"Basic Concepts"**.

The actual first step with the ESP32 is to download and install the Arduino IDE and configure the environment for our board. The steps to follow can be found in **"Config Arduino IDE for ESP32"**.
